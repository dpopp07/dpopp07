👨🏻‍💻 I’m a software engineer working professionally on developer experience, web APIs, and the tools associated with them - SDKs, CLIs, Terraform, OpenAPI, etc.
On the side, I enjoy working on fullstack applications that are fun to build, because it's fun to build them.

🛠️ Developing tools for [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) and the [IBM Cloud API Handbook](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-intro).

🎵 Outside of software, performing and recording music with [5 Star Motel](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7IMJRL5vHrhhuAqtFc0bAP?si=SkYds3ZRRQOaWBcwE6xBow).
